# about this project

Well, you know, due to covid-19's out break and our "great" CCP's "No Infected Alive Policy" (known as "清零政策" in chinese), we students have to stay at home to learn online.

The thing itself is nothing good nor bad, but the f\*\*king PRC Ministry of Education, which has a great team of leaders wise enough to eat s\*\*t, we have to do exercise at home.

However, I have to admit that exercise alone is of great help to our bodies. But the programme we use to confirm whether we make it is so crap.

So, for our mental health, we must act to againist the foolish group of leadership. 

A lot of my classmates have made their parts' of effort.(Thank all you, I really really love you all!)

This work can be thought as my part.
